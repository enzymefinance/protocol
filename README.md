# protocol

Melon ([méllō], μέλλω; Greek for "destined to be") is blockchain software that seeks to enable participants to set up, manage and invest in technology regulated investment funds in a way that reduces barriers to entry while minimizing the requirements for trust.

It does so by leveraging off the fact that digital assets on distributed quasi turing complete machines can be held solely by smart-contract code and spent only if its preprogrammed within this code. The Melon protocol is a set of rules for how digital assets can be spent once held in a Melon smart-contract, or a Melon investment fund. It's meant to protect the investor and fund manager from malevolent behaviour of each other.

Melon is for wealth management what Bitcoin is for accounting, a set of rules, enforced by blockchain technology, legitimized by the consent of its participants.

This repository contains a reference implementation of the Melon protocol written in Solidity, as specified in our [paper][paper-url].

## Implementation

### Governance

<img src = "https://github.com/melonproject/branding/blob/master/explanation/governance.png" width = "100%">

The main functionality of the [Governance](contracts/system/Governance.sol) contract is to add new protocol _versions_ such as this [Version](contracts/version/Version.sol) contract and to shut down existing versions once they become obsolete.

Adding new protocol version is done by anyone _proposing_ a version to be added and is _executed_ once authority consensus has been established.

Shutting down an existing protocol version is done by anyone _proposing_ a version to be shut down and is _executed_ once authority consensus has been established.

Shutting down a version disables the ability to setup new funds using this version and enables anyone to shut down any existing funds of this version.

### Funds

The Participation module takes as input the following parameters:

**Requests:** Describes and logs whenever asset enter and leave fund due to Participants

Name | Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
participant | `address` | Participant in Melon fund requesting subscription or redemption
status | `enum` | Enum: active, cancelled, executed; Status of request
requestType | `enum` | Enum: subscribe, redeem
shareQuantity | `uint256` | Quantity of Melon fund shares
giveQuantity | `uint256` | Quantity in Melon asset to give to Melon fund to receive shareQuantity
receiveQuantity | `uint256` | Quantity in Melon asset to receive from Melon fund for given shareQuantity
incentiveQuantity | `uint256` | Quantity in Melon asset to give to person executing request
lastDataFeedUpdateId | `uint256` | Data feed module specifc id of last update
lastDataFeedUpdateTime | `uint256` | Data feed module specifc timestamp of last update
timestamp | `uint256` | Time of request creation

While the Risk Management module takes as input the following parameters:

**Orders:** Describes and logs whenever assets enter and leave fund due to Manager

Name | Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
exchangeId | `uint256` | Id as returned from exchange
status | `enum` | Enum: active, partiallyFilled, fullyFilled, cancelled
orderType | `enum` | Enum: make, take
sellAsset | `address` | Asset (as registred in Asset registrar) to be sold
buyAsset | `address` | Asset (as registred in Asset registrar) to be bought
sellQuantity | `uint256` | Quantity of sellAsset to be sold
buyQuantity | `uint256` |  Quantity of sellAsset to be bought
timestamp | `uint256` | Time in seconds when this order was created
fillQuantity | `uint256` | Buy quantity filled; Always less than buy_quantity

### Modules

<img src = "https://github.com/melonproject/branding/blob/master/explanation/fund.png" width = "100%">

### List of Melon modules

Melon has six different module classes:
- Exchange Adapters
- Rewards
- Participation
- Risk Management
- Asset registrars
- Data feeds

Which can be categorized into three sub sets:
- Libraries
- Boolean function
- Infrastructure

#### Libraries

These Melon modules are:
- Exchange Adapters
- Rewards

They interact with the Melon protocol using as pre-linked libraries to the Melon version contract.

#### Boolean functions

These Melon modules are:
- Participation
- Risk Managment

They interact with the Melon protocol using boolean functions. That is functions which take a certain set of inputs and return either true or false.

#### Infrastructure

These Melon modules are:
- Asset registrars
- Data feeds

These are modules security critical infrastructure modules.
The reason they are security criticial is that the correctness of the data they provide cannot directly be enforced or guaranteed.

## Interaction

Smart contract interaction for the following scenarios:
- Setup of a new Melon fund
- Participant invests in a Melon fund
- Participant redeems from a Melon fund
- Manager makes an order
- Manager takes an order
- Manager converts rewards into shares
- Manager shuts down the fund


## Get started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
    ```
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:melonproject/protocol.git
    cd protocol
    ```

2. Install dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Generate bytecode and abi of smart-contracts using [dapp](https://github.com/dapphub/dapp) suite

    ```
    npm run compile
    ```

### Testing

After installation is complete, go to the above `protocol` directory, open a terminal and:

1. Launch a testrpc client:
    ```
    npm run localnode
    ```

2. Open a second terminal and run the test framework:
    ```
    npm test
    ```

### Linting

After installation is complete, go to the above `protocol` directory, open a terminal and run:

`npm run lint`


### Deployment

After installation is complete, go to the above `protocol` directory, open a terminal and:

1. Launch a ethereum client. For example something similar to this:
    ```
    parity --chain kovan --author <some address> --unlock <some address> --password <some password file>
    ```

2. Open a second terminal and deploy contracts using truffle
    ```
    truffle migrate --network kovan
    ```

## Contribute

As an open-source project we welcome any kind of community involvement. Whether that is by contributing code, reporting issues or engaging in insightful discussions.

### Security Issues

If you find a vulnerability that may affect live or kovan deployments please send your report privately to admin@melonport.com. Please DO NOT file a public issue.

### Protocol Design

When considering protocol design proposals, we are looking for:

- A description of the problem this design proposal solves
- Discussion of the tradeoffs involved
- Review of other existing solutions
- Links to relevant literature (RFCs, papers, etc)
- Discussion of the proposed solution

Please note that protocol design is hard, and meticulous work. You may need to review existing literature and think through generalized use cases.

### Implementation Design

When considering design proposals for implementations, we are looking for:

- A description of the problem this design proposal solves
- Discussion of the tradeoffs involved
- Discussion of the proposed solution
